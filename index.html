        Hi there! <br><br>
        A thing of fascination at this point in time is that I, who never thought that this
        would be something that I would actively pursue, am finding it to be pretty interesting. <br><br>
        What I am about to share with you now is currently, by far <strong>THE MOST IMPORTANT</strong> thing that I feel I can
        accomplish! <br>
        Whenever we receive a message, we usually tend to perceive it in the sender's voice. It you find yourself hearing my voice
        while reading the following, just know that it is quite normal, to an extent, intentional on both our ends. <br><br>
        As a person, I have always held back from giving away too much information about myself, both past and current,
        and my personal life. I worked both as a Freelance Content Writer and a Teacher, although the Writer part was more or less
        a pain since I was heavily limitied to writing content for product-based technical field, fashion industry and real estate.
        This resulted in me losing interest in writing and I procrastinated almost 90% of my time and more often than not, ended
        up submitting my work usually half an hour before the deadline. The teaching job was a lot more fun and lively. It had
        me working alongside kids (I know what you're thinking😏), trying to impart to them both academic knowledge and good values,
        while retaining their attention for the longest amount of time possible. It also had me incorporating my remaining mental
        and physical faculties (well, whatever was left of them anyway) that I hadn't short-circuited trying to figure out what
        <strong><em>ghaghra</em></strong> went with a particular <strong><em>choli</em></strong> for marriage and festive seasons. <br><br>

        After leaving the job, I had way too much time left on my hands, and after receiving a heartbreaking rejection from a
        certain someone, I wasn't able to get back to normal. That was when a course was recommended to me by my <strong><a href="friend_definition.html">friend</a></strong>.
        with the intention of improving my typing speed and frying my brains out, since he saw that I had nothing but time
        and I wasn't pursuing something *cough Luffy* that he was deeply passionate about. Thus, after keeping in mind my dire
        lack of skills, I decided to upgrade myself, and after a lot of thought and introspection, I came upon the conclusion
        that by combining my previous experience as a Content Writer and a Teacher, and by adding my abundance of time, I can
        actually write content that forces people like you to read and keeps your attention for the longest possible amount of time. <br>
        You might be wondering, what was the purpose of giving all this information? Was there even a point to be made?<br>
        The answer is - absolutely NO! <br> <br>

        I am glad that you read all the way till here, and that it was my voice in your head that led you to finish! <br>
        You too, just like me, have a lot of time on your hand, which I would recommend, you use fruitfully!



        <br><br> Thank you for wasting your time reading this piece of junk.
        <br><br> Hope you have a wonderful day!
    </p>
